    <p>Welcome to Tacori, where we believe every taco is more than just a meal—it’s
        an experience, a celebration of flavors, and a story wrapped in a tortilla. 
        Born from the passion for authentic Mexican cuisine and a love 
        for crafting memorable moments, Tacori is not just a taco 
        shop—it’s a journey to the heart of great taste.

        <br> Our name, Tacori, is inspired by a blend of tradition and 
        innovation. We’re rooted in the authentic taco traditions 
        passed down through generations, but we also love to push 
        the boundaries, experimenting with new flavors, creative 
        fillings, and unique combinations. Every taco at Tacori is 
        a reflection of our mission: to make something familiar, 
        yet extraordinary.
        
        Here at Tacori, we aim to prepare a dish overpouring with 
        love and joy. </p>
